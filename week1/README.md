### What I Learned In Week 1
In this week I was introduced to the foundations of programming using C language.
Some concepts that were explored during lecture:
- Programming logic and how computers execute instructions.
- C language syntax and structure.
- Differences between source code and machine code.
- Basic understanding of compilers and compilation steps.
- Writing code with correctness, good design and clean style
- Using libraries and reading manual pages for research.
- What Data Types are and how to use each inside variables.
- Conditional statements for selective structures.
- The usage of nested loops (for, while, do-while)
- Command-Line Interface (CLI) usage.
- Pseudocode and problem-solving before code.
- Mathematical operators.
- Integer overflow and floating-point imprecision.

### Problem Set Solutions
- **mario.c**:
Prints a right-aligned pyramid of hashes based on user's input of it's height.
- **cash.c**:
Calculates minimum number of coins require to give change, also based on user's input of change.

This repository stores my personal learning process — code may be improved later as I grow and revisit earlier solutions.

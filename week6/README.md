# Week 6 - Python

This week introduced Python as a higher-level language and focused on reimplementing earlier logic with clearer syntax and built-in data structures.
The *dna.py* problem set emphasized string processing, dictionaries, use of Python libraries and algorithmic thinking.

-**dna.py**: Identifies an individual by comparing DNA STR counts from a sequence against a database of known profiles.

## Week 4 – Memory

This week focused on memory management in C, including pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and file I/O.
The problem sets required working directly with raw memory, manipulating data at the byte level, and understanding how images and files are represented in memory.

- **volume.c**: Modifies the volume of an audio file by scaling each audio sample by a specified factor.
- **filter (helpers.c/filter.c)**: Applies image filters such as grayscale, sepia, reflection, and blur by directly manipulating pixel data in memory.
- **recover.c**: Recovers JPEG images from a raw memory card dump by detecting .jpg file signatures and reconstructing image files.

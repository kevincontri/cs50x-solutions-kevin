# CS50x – Problem Set Solutions
Official Course: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/

This repository contains my solutions to the problems proposed by the Harvard course **"CS50x - Introduction to Computer Science"**.
I do not publish the problem statements due to copyright issues. Only the code I wrote.

**Here I plan to:**
- Keep track of my progress in programming (C, Python, SQL, HTML + CSS + JS, Flask)
- Keep a learning diary
- Show organization and progress for future opportunities

**Repo structure:**
Each week of the course will have its own folder, for example:
week1/
week2/
week3/

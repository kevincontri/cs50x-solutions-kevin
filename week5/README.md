# Week 5 - Data Structures

This week introduced core data structures and how they are implemented at a low level in C.
It focused on using structures, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation to model real-world problems efficiently.

- **inheritance.c**: Simulates genetic inheritance across multiple generations by recursively modeling family trees and allele transmission.
- **speller.c**: Implements a spell checker using a hash table to efficiently load, check, and unload words from a dictionary.

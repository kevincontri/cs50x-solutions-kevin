## Week 3 – Algorithms

This week I learned on fundamental algorithms used to search and sort data efficiently.
I learned how to analyze algorithmic performance using Big O notation and how different approaches impact runtime with scalability.

- **plurality.c**: Implements a plurality voting system by counting votes and determining the candidate with the highest total.
- **runoff.c**: Simulates a runoff election by redistributing votes based on voter preferences until a there's a winner.

Q: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
A: A slightly energetic mood, not overly cheerful, but with plenty of rhythm for dancing.

Q: Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
A: Well, each person might interact differently with each type of song, for there might have some specifications
the computer doesn't read at all, and getting the average is just calculating some numbers provided by the data.

Better ways would be by checking more factors, such as the songs the user played the most, and by that, check
the lyrics, tempo and genre. Maybe checking the skip rate from other songs, could also help identifying what
the user does not like to listen.

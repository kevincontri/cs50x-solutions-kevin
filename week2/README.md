### Week 2 Learning

This week I learned more details about compiling and how data is stored within computer's memory. 
I explored arrays in depth, including how they store data in contiguous (back-to-back) memory locations, and how strings are simply arrays of characters.
I also practiced debugging techniques, learned how to interact with arrays in C, and worked with CL arguments to pass input directly to programs.

### Problem Set Solutions 
- **scrabble.c**: Calculates Scrabble word scores by assigning point values to letters and comparing two players’ words.
- **readability.c**: Analyzes a text and computes its reading grade level using the Coleman–Liau index.
- **caesar.c**: Encrypts text using the Caesar cipher by shifting letters based on a numeric key provided via the command line.
- **substitution.c**: Encrypts text using a substitution cipher defined by a user-provided alphabet mapping.
